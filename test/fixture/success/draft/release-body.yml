# Currently, draft release bodies cannot be end-to-end tested. The release body
# needs to be requested via a browser in order to properly evaluate the final
# HTML that gets produced.
#
# Since draft releases cannot be seen by unauthenticated users, the browser
# would need to sign in to GitHub web UI in order to read release bodies for
# draft releases. The effort involved outweighs the benefits in this case.
